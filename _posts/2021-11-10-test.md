### Introduction

PortSwigger has introduced the **Burp Suite Certified Practitioner** accreditation this year. It is a **three-hour** exam and by passing one you'll be able to demonstrate the ability to:

- Detect and exploit common web vulnerabilities.
- Display knowledge of fundamental web technologies
- Adapt attacks to evade common defenses.

The Burp Suite Certified Practitioner exam costs **$99** and you will need to have an **active subscription** to Burp Suite Professional. You can get certified by using only this 3 steps.

Also, if you pass the exam before 15 Dec they will **refund** your $99!

### Burp Suite Certified Practitioner Practice Exam

I will not go further into the explanation of the practice exam as you can read more in [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/practice-exam) . But there are three (3) stages that we need to complete:

- **Stage 1**: Access any user account.
- **Stage 2**: Use your user account to access the admin interface at **/admin**, perhaps by elevating your privileges or compromising the administrator account.
- **Stage 3**: Use the admin interface to read the contents of **/home/carlos/secret** from the server's filesystem, and submit it using **"submit solution"**.

Before we go through the practice exam, there are few things to take notes.
